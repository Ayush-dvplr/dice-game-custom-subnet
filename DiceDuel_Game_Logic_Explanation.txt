Game Logic Explanation for DiceDuel Solidity Contract

1. Overview:
   - The DiceDuel contract is an ERC20 token contract that introduces a dice-rolling game where players can bet tokens.
   - The contract owner has the exclusive rights to mint and burn tokens.
   - Players can roll a virtual dice by betting a certain amount of tokens. If the player's roll is higher than the contract's roll, the player wins and receives double their bet amount.

2. Contract Initialization:
   - The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC20 standard implementation.
   - Upon deployment, the contract initializes with the token name "DiceDuelToken" (symbol: "DDT").
   - The contract deployer is set as the owner.

3. Key Functions:

   a. `mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner`:
      - Allows the contract owner to mint (create) new tokens and assign them to a specific address.
      - Emits a "Minted" event upon successful minting.

   b. `burn(address from, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner`:
      - Allows the contract owner to burn (destroy) a specified amount of tokens from a particular address.
      - Emits a "Burned" event upon successful burning.

   c. `rollDice(uint256 betAmount) public`:
      - The core game function where players bet a specified amount of tokens.
      - Requirements:
          - The bet amount must be greater than 0.
          - The player's token balance must be sufficient to cover the bet.
      - Process:
          1. The bet amount is transferred from the player to the contract.
          2. A random dice roll (1 to 6) is generated for the player.
          3. Another random dice roll (1 to 6) is generated for the contract.
          4. The player wins if their roll is higher than the contract's roll.
             - If the player wins, they receive double the bet amount in newly minted tokens.
             - If the player loses, the bet amount is burned (removed from circulation).
      - Emits a "DiceRolled" event with details of the player's roll, contract's roll, and the outcome.

   d. `randomDiceRoll(address source, uint256 seed) private view returns (uint256)`:
      - A helper function to generate a pseudo-random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive) based on the input parameters.
      - Uses `keccak256` hashing for randomness, which is deterministic but unpredictable within the context of this contract.

4. Events:
   - `Minted(address indexed to, uint256 amount)` is emitted when tokens are minted.
   - `Burned(address indexed from, uint256 amount)` is emitted when tokens are burned.
   - `DiceRolled(address indexed player, uint256 playerRoll, uint256 contractRoll, bool win)` is emitted after each dice roll, recording the player's and contract's rolls and whether the player won.

5. Security Considerations:
   - The randomness generated by `randomDiceRoll` is not truly random as it depends on block attributes and the source address. This might be exploitable under certain circumstances.
   - The contract's reliance on the owner for minting and burning tokens centralizes control and requires trust in the owner's actions.

6. Conclusion:
   - The DiceDuel contract offers a straightforward betting game leveraging an ERC20 token. Players can engage in a simple dice duel, betting their tokens with the possibility of winning additional tokens.
